# Setting Up an OBi 202 Adapter with Hams over IP

I have an analog telephone adapter (ATA) that lets me connect POTS phones to VoIP services.  Here's how to get your ATA working with Hams over IP.

## Logging in to the Device

I already have another VoIP service configured, so I will be configuring what the device calls **Service Provider 2** (or sometimes "B").

OBiTALK devices used to be configurable online with OBiNET but this service has now been discontinued by Polycom in 2024, so my directions will cover setting up the device manually, using its built-in Web server; for example, `http://192.0.2.2`.

When using the built-in Web server, you will find that almost all advanced options are greyed out until you un-check that row's Default checkbox.

## Service Provider Profile Configuration

On the left-hand side, under **Service Providers**, click on **ITSP Profile B**.

Under the General section:

* Name: Hams over IP
* SignalingProtocol: SIP

SIP section:

* ProxyServer: `pbx-us1.hamsoverip.com` (or your server name)
* ProxyServerPort: `5160`
* ProxyServerTransport: `UDP`
* OutboundProxy: `pbx-us1.hamsoverip.com` (or your server name)
* OutboundProxyPort: `5160`
* RegisterExpires: `3600`
* X_SessionRefresh: unchecked
* X_LineSeizeSubscribeExpires: `30`

## Voice Service Configuration

Under the **Voice Services** heading, click on **SP2 Service**.

* Enable: checked
* X_ServProvProfile: `B`
* X_RingProfile: `B`
* X_CodecProfile: `B`
* X_RegisterEnable: checked
* X_UserAgentPort: `5081`
* AuthUserName: your extension
* AuthPassword: your password
* URI: (blank)
* X_EnforceRequestUserID: checked
* X_SRTP: `Disable SRTP`

Under **CallerIDName**, enter your caller ID as you want other people to see it.  I used my full name and call sign.  I'm not sure if HoIP overrides this setting or not.

## That's it

Finally, reboot the device and see if the extension will register.  Now, pick up whatever telephone you've plugged into your ATA and see if you get a dial tone!

(Yes, this 50-year-old phone actually works with HoIP!  The OBi ATA is under my desk and not pictured.)
