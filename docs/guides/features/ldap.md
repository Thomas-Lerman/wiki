# Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP)

!!! success "You can now get to this page using a shorter URL: [hamsoverip.github.io/ldap](https://hamsoverip.github.io/ldap)"

Hams Over IP now supports a phone-based directory of HOIP users using LDAP which a large number of phones can support.  Whilst the implementation and usage of this directory differs between devices - sometimes significantly - the information needed to implement it is the same.  We've included phone-specific instructions below, but also the basic information so that you can set this up on a phone we haven't mentioned.

    Some of these are specific to certain kinds of devices
