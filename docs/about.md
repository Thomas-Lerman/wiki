# What is Hams Over IP?

Hams Over IP is a voice-over-IP service for the Ham Radio community. Ham Radio Operators from all over the world have volunteered their time, skills, and resources to create and support this dynamic service.

## What we offer

* a fully-featured, searchable, BLF-integrated [phonebook :material-open-in-new:](https://hamsoverip.com/phonebook){ target="_blank" }
* [LDAP](./guides/features/ldap.md) support for capable devices
* cross-server [BLF](./guides/features/blf.md) for capable devices
* up to TEN endpoints per extension
* IAX and SIP [Trunks](./guides/pbx/index.md)
* Conference Bridges for Individuals, Clubs, and Groups
* RF Links into the AllStar system - use your phone as a radio!

Whilst we don't directly support any particular devices, we invite and encourage users to Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) to connect to our service.  We do have a number of [Configuration Guides](./guides/index.md) for some of the more popular phones and apps, with more being added all the time.  We welcome contributions to those Guides, particularly as the Support team don't have every possible device at their disposal to create the Guides themselves.

## Who we are

Our Support team is based around the world, covering most timezones.  We encourage you to raise a support ticket for most issues, although you may try reaching out on the [:fontawesome-brands-discord: #support :material-open-in-new:](https://discord.com/channels/966060559961296956/1328885937526149121){ target="_blank" } channel on our Discord server
